# all about jellies! Ë™ âœ©Â°Ë–ðŸª¼ â‹†ï½¡Ëšâ€¢
jellies are very versatile creatures that, technically, should not be called jellyfish. these creatures do not fit the traditional classifications for fish and therefore, are called sea jellies!


## my favorite types of jellies
- moon jellies
- pacific sea nettle
